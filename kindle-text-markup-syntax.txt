When eMail-ing plain text files to the Kindle, it processes some form of minimal markup that include emphasis, bulet
points, monospace text and horizontal lines (plus probably more). Here is a description of what I found so far (mostly
by accident):

*emphasis*

* bullet point

==== horizontal line

[some form of indent] monospace text
